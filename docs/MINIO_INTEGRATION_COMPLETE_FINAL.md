# MinIO Integration - FINAL COMPLETION ✅

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FULLY WORKING**  
**Scope:** Document Service Only

---

## 🎉 **SUCCESS - All Issues Resolved!**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
1. ✅ Upload documents with files to MinIO
2. ✅ Download files from MinIO
3. ✅ **Delete files from MinIO** (FIXED!)
4. ✅ **Delete document → File deleted from MinIO** (FIXED!)
5. ✅ File metadata saved and returned in API
6. ✅ File existence checking
7. ✅ File info endpoint
8. ✅ Health checks
9. ✅ Automatic fallback to local storage

---

## 🐛 **Issues Found & Fixed:**

### Issue 1: File Metadata Not Saving
**Problem:** File metadata (originalFilename, contentType, fileSize) wasn't being saved during upload.

**Fix:** 
- Created `attachFileWithMetadata()` method
- Updated upload endpoint to save metadata

### Issue 2: Metadata Not Returned in API
**Problem:** Metadata was saved to database but not returned in API responses.

**Fix:**
- Added metadata fields to `DocumentResponse` DTO
- Updated `DocumentMapper` to map metadata fields

### Issue 3: Delete Document Doesn't Delete File from MinIO ⭐ **CRITICAL**
**Problem:** When deleting a document, the file remained in MinIO storage (orphaned).

**Fix:**
- Injected `FileStorageGateway` into `DocumentServiceImpl`
- Updated `deleteDocument()` to delete file from storage before deleting DB record

---

## 📁 **Files Modified (Final List):**

### Phase 1: Infrastructure
1. ✅ `infra/docker-compose-infrastructure.yaml` - Created unified infrastructure

### Phase 2: Service Layer
2. ✅ `document-service/src/main/resources/application.properties` - Updated MinIO config
3. ✅ `MinIOFileStorageService.java` - Added delete, exists, fileSize, list methods
4. ✅ `LocalFileStorageService.java` - Added delete, exists, fileSize methods
5. ✅ `FileStorageGateway.java` - Added delete, exists, getFileSize methods
6. ✅ `FileStorageGatewayFeign.java` - Implemented new methods

### Phase 3: Data Layer
7. ✅ `Document.java` - Added file metadata fields
8. ✅ `DocumentService.java` - Added attachFileWithMetadata, clearFileMetadata
9. ✅ `DocumentServiceImpl.java` - Implemented metadata methods + **DELETE FIX**

### Phase 4: API Layer
10. ✅ `DocumentResponse.java` - Added metadata fields
11. ✅ `DocumentMapper.java` - Map metadata fields
12. ✅ `DocumentController.java` - Added file management endpoints

### Phase 5: DevOps
13. ✅ `start-infrastructure.ps1` - Startup script
14. ✅ `stop-infrastructure.ps1` - Shutdown script
15. ✅ `test-minio-integration.ps1` - Test script

## 📋 **API Endpoints Available:**

### File Operations
- `POST /api/v1/documents/{id}/upload` - Upload file
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/download` - Download file
- `DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}/file` - Delete file only
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/file/info` - Get file metadata
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/file/exists` - Check if exists

### Document Operations
- `GET /api/v1/documents` - List all documents (includes metadata)
- `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}` - Get document (includes metadata)
- `DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}` - Delete document + file ⭐ **NOW DELETES FILE!**

### Health
- `GET /api/v1/documents/health/minio` - MinIO health check

---

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

### 1. Start Infrastructure
```powershell
.\start-infrastructure.ps1
```

### 2. Start Document Service
```powershell
cd document-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Upload a Document
Via UI or:
```powershell
$file = Get-Item "test.pdf"
$form = @{file = $file; user = "TestUser"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/documents/{id}/upload" -Method Post -Form $form
```

### 4. Verify in MinIO Console
- Open: http://localhost:9001
- Login: minio / password
- Check: plm-documents bucket

### 5. Delete Document
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/documents/{id}" -Method Delete
```

### 6. Verify File Gone from MinIO
Refresh MinIO Console - file should be deleted!

## 📊 **What We Built:**

### Infrastructure (Phase 1 & 4)
✅ Unified Docker Compose with MinIO + Redis  
✅ Automatic bucket creation  
✅ Health checks  
✅ Startup/shutdown scripts  

### Service Layer (Phase 2)
✅ Enhanced MinIO service with full CRUD  
✅ File metadata tracking  
✅ Better logging (SLF4J)  
✅ Error handling  
✅ Fallback mechanism  

### API Layer (Phase 3)
✅ File management endpoints  
✅ Delete file endpoint  
✅ File info endpoint  
✅ Health check endpoint  
✅ Metadata in all responses  

### Critical Fixes
✅ Metadata saving during upload  
✅ Metadata returned in API  
✅ **Delete document deletes file from MinIO**

## 🎓 **Lessons Learned:**

1. **Always check the DTO layer** - Data might be saved but not returned
2. **Cascade deletes** - When deleting parent entities, clean up related files
3. **Test end-to-end** - Database, API, and storage must all work together
4. **User feedback is valuable** - The delete bug was critical and user-reported

---

## 📝 **Configuration Reference:**

### MinIO Settings
```properties
minio.url=http://localhost:9000
minio.access-key=minio
minio.secret-key=password
minio.bucket=plm-documents
```

### Ports
- MinIO API: 9000
