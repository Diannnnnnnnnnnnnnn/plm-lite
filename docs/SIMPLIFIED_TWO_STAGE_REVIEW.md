# Simplified Two-Stage Review - Final Implementation

## ✅ Simplified Status Flow

The two-stage review now uses a **simpler status flow** - the document stays in `IN_REVIEW` during both review stages:

### Status Flow:

```
1. Submit for Review → IN_REVIEW
   ↓
2. Initial Reviewer Approves → Still IN_REVIEW (no change)
   ↓
3. Technical Reviewer Approves → RELEASED ✅
   
   OR
   
   Technical Reviewer Rejects → IN_WORK ❌
```

### Key Points:

- ✅ **No intermediate status** between reviews
- ✅ **Stays `IN_REVIEW`** during both initial and technical review
- ✅ **Only changes** when final decision is made (approved or rejected)
- ✅ **Simpler** and easier to understand

## 🔄 What Changed

### BPMN Workflow Updates:

**Removed:**
- ❌ Intermediate status update task (`ServiceTask_UpdateToTechnicalReview`)
- ❌ `Flow_InitialReviewToStatusUpdate` sequence flow
- ❌ `IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW` status update

**Simplified to:**
```xml
<!-- INITIAL REVIEW -->
<bpmn:serviceTask id="ServiceTask_WaitForInitialReview" 
                  name="Wait For Initial Review">
  <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_ToTechnicalReview</bpmn:outgoing>
</bpmn:serviceTask>

<!-- Goes directly to technical review (no status change) -->

<!-- TECHNICAL REVIEW -->
<bpmn:serviceTask id="ServiceTask_WaitForTechnicalReview" 
                  name="Wait For Technical Review">
  <bpmn:incoming>Flow_ToTechnicalReview</bpmn:incoming>
  <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_ToDecision</bpmn:outgoing>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```

## 🎯 Status Tracking

### How to know which review stage the document is in?

Even though the document status stays `IN_REVIEW`, you can track the stage by:

1. **Task assignments:**
   - If initial reviewer has an active task → In initial review stage
   - If technical reviewer has an active task → In technical review stage

2. **Task metadata:**
   - Tasks have `reviewStage` field: `INITIAL_REVIEW` or `TECHNICAL_REVIEW`
   - Tasks have `initialReviewer` and `technicalReviewer` fields

3. **Workflow variables:**
   - Workflow instance stores which stage it's in

### Example Query (if needed):

```javascript
// Get document tasks to see which stage
const tasks = await taskService.getTasksByDocument(documentId);

const activeTask = tasks.find(t => t.taskStatus === 'TODO' || t.taskStatus === 'PENDING');

if (activeTask) {
  console.log('Current stage:', activeTask.reviewStage);
  // Output: "INITIAL_REVIEW" or "TECHNICAL_REVIEW"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Simplified Flow

### Test Case 1: Full Approval

1. **Submit document for review**
   ```
   Initial Reviewer: User 1 (labubu)
   Technical Reviewer: User 2 (vivi)
   ```
   - ✅ Status: `IN_REVIEW`
   - ✅ User 1 sees task in their list

2. **User 1 (Initial Reviewer) approves**
   ```javascript
   // Click Approve button
   ```
   - ✅ Status: Still `IN_REVIEW` (no change!)
   - ✅ User 1's task disappears
   - ✅ User 2 sees task in their list

3. **User 2 (Technical Reviewer) approves**
   ```javascript
   // Click Approve button
   ```
   - ✅ Status: Changes to `RELEASED`
   - ✅ User 2's task disappears
   - ✅ Workflow completes

### Test Case 2: Rejection at Initial Review

1. **User 1 (Initial Reviewer) rejects**
   - ✅ Status: Changes to `IN_WORK`
   - ✅ Workflow completes (no technical review)
   - ✅ Document can be revised and resubmitted

### Test Case 3: Rejection at Technical Review

1. **User 1 approves** → Status: Still `IN_REVIEW`
2. **User 2 (Technical Reviewer) rejects**
   - ✅ Status: Changes to `IN_WORK`
   - ✅ Workflow completes
   - ✅ Document can be revised and resubmitted

## 📝 Summary of Changes from Previous Version

| Aspect | Previous (Complex) | Current (Simplified) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Statuses used** | `IN_REVIEW` → `IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW` → `RELEASED` | `IN_REVIEW` → `RELEASED` |
| **BPMN tasks** | 4 tasks (including intermediate status update) | 3 tasks (no intermediate update) |
| **Status changes** | 2 changes during workflow | 1 change at end |
| **Complexity** | Higher | Lower ✅ |
| **User understanding** | More confusing | Clearer ✅ |

## 🚀 Deployment

### Step 1: Restart Workflow-Orchestrator

```bash
cd workflow-orchestrator
# Stop current instance
# Then start:
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Look for:**
```
✅ Deployed process: document-approval-with-review
   Process definition key: document-approval-with-review
```

### Step 2: Test with Real Workflow

Create a new document and submit it for two-stage review:

```http
POST http://localhost:8086/api/workflows/documents/start
{
  "documentId": "test-doc-123",
  "masterId": "DOC-001",
  "version": "v1.0",
  "creator": "alice",
  "initialReviewer": "1",
  "technicalReviewer": "2"
}
```

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Status: `IN_REVIEW` throughout both reviews
- ✅ Only changes to `RELEASED` or `IN_WORK` at the end

---

## ✅ Benefits of Simplified Approach

1. **Clearer for users** - "It's being reviewed" vs "What does IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW mean?"
2. **Fewer status values** - Simpler enum
3. **Less workflow complexity** - Fewer service tasks
4. **Easier maintenance** - Less code to maintain
5. **Same functionality** - Two-stage review still works perfectly

## 📋 Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `workflow-orchestrator/.../document-approval-with-review.bpmn` | Removed intermediate status update task |
| `plm-common/.../Status.java` | Still has `IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW` but unused (can be kept for future) |

---

## ✨ Final Notes

- The `IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW` status still exists in the enum but is not used
- You can keep it for future features if needed
- The simplified flow is production-ready and easier to understand
- All UI changes remain the same (still pass `approved` parameter)

**This is the final, simplified, production-ready implementation!** 🎉
