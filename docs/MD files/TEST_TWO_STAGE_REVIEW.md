### ‚úÖ Test 4: Rejection Flow - Initial Review Rejects

**Steps**:
1-6. Same as Test 1
7. Login as Alice
8. Open initial review task
9. **Reject** the document (mark as COMPLETED with approved=false)

2. Select Alice as Initial Reviewer
3. Try to select Alice as Technical Reviewer

**Expected**:
- Alice is disabled/unavailable in Technical Reviewer column

### ‚úÖ Test 7: Backward Compatibility - Legacy Single Reviewer

**Steps**:
1. Use legacy API format:
```json
POST /api/workflows/document-approval/start

  "documentId": "doc-123",
  "reviewerIds": ["3"]
}
```

**Expected**:
- Uses `document-approval` process (not `document-approval-with-review`)
- Single-stage review workflow
- Works as before

- [ ] Initial review task creates with correct reviewer
- [ ] Auto-progression from initial to technical review
- [ ] Technical review task creates with correct reviewer
- [ ] Workflow completes successfully on approval
- [ ] Workflow handles rejection correctly
- [ ] Legacy API still works

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: BPMN Not Deploying
**Solution**: Check `workflow-orchestrator` logs for deployment errors. Ensure the BPMN file is valid XML.

### Issue 2: Workers Not Registering
**Solution**: Verify `DocumentWorkflowWorkers.registerWorkers()` is called on startup. Check for Zeebe connection issues.

### Issue 3: Tasks Not Creating
**Solution**: Check TaskServiceClient Feign configuration. Ensure task-service is running on port 8082.

### Issue 4: Review Stage Not Showing in UI
**Solution**: Verify task entity has the new fields. Check frontend is reading `reviewStage`, `initialReviewer`, `technicalReviewer` from task object.

### Issue 5: Auto-progression Not Working
**Solution**: Check that `workflowJobKey` is being stored in tasks. Verify TaskController status update endpoint completes workflow jobs.
