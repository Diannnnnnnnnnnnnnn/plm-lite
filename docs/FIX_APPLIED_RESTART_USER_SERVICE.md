# ✅ Fix Applied - Restart User-Service

## What Was Fixed
Added the missing `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency to user-service's `pom.xml`.

This was needed for the health check endpoints and Redis health indicator.

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Stop the user-service window
- Find the PowerShell window running user-service
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it
- Close the window

### Step 2: Restart user-service
```powershell
cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or use the shortcut:
```powershell
cd user-service; Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "mvn spring-boot:run" -WindowStyle Normal; cd ..
```

### Step 3: Wait for it to start (2-3 minutes)
Look for: `Started UserServiceApplication`

### Step 4: Run the tests
```powershell
.\quick-test-redis.ps1
```

## Why This Happened
The health check feature (`RedisHealthIndicator`) requires Spring Boot Actuator, which provides:
- `/actuator/health` endpoint
- Health indicator interfaces
- Monitoring capabilities

Auth-service already had this dependency, but user-service was missing it.

## Now You're Ready!
Once user-service restarts successfully, all 5 tests should pass. ✅
