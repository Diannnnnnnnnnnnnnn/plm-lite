# CRITICAL FIX: Document Status Jumping to RELEASED

## 🐛 Problem Found

When the **first reviewer** approved their task, the document status was immediately changing to **RELEASED** instead of **IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW**. This completely bypassed the second stage of the two-stage review!

## 🔍 Root Cause

In `TaskManager.js`, the code was calling **BOTH**:

1. `documentService.completeReview()` - which **directly** changes status to RELEASED
2. `taskService.updateTaskStatus()` - which triggers the workflow

This was the **old single-stage review pattern** that directly updated the document status.

### Before (WRONG):
```javascript
// TaskManager.js - handleApproveReview()
await documentService.completeReview(documentId, true, 'Current User', 'Approved');
// ❌ This immediately changes status to RELEASED!

await taskService.updateTaskStatus(selectedTaskForDetails.id, 'COMPLETED', true, 'Approved');
// The workflow tries to update status, but it's already RELEASED!
```

## ✅ Solution

For **workflow-managed reviews**, the UI should **ONLY** update the task status and let the **workflow** handle all document status changes via the BPMN process.

### After (CORRECT):
```javascript
// TaskManager.js - handleApproveReview()
// REMOVED: documentService.completeReview() call
// Only update task status - workflow handles the rest!
await taskService.updateTaskStatus(selectedTaskForDetails.id, 'COMPLETED', true, 'Approved');
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Workflow Controls Status Changes:

```
1. Document Submitted → Status: IN_REVIEW
   ↓
2. Wait for Initial Review
   ↓ (user clicks Approve)
3. Task status → COMPLETED (with approved=true)
   ↓ (workflow receives completion)
4. Workflow: Update Status → IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW ✅
   ↓
5. Wait for Technical Review
   ↓ (user clicks Approve)
6. Task status → COMPLETED (with approved=true)
   ↓ (workflow receives completion)
7. Workflow: Update Status → RELEASED ✅
```

### The Workflow BPMN Flow:

```
[Initial Review Completes]
        ↓
[Update Status: IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW] ← Workflow service task
        ↓
[Wait for Technical Review]
        ↓
[Technical Review Completes]
        ↓
[Decision Gateway: approved?]
    ↙         ↘
  Yes          No
   ↓            ↓
[Update Status: [Update Status:
   RELEASED]      IN_WORK]
```

## 🔧 Files Changed

### `frontend/src/components/Tasks/TaskManager.js`

**Changed `handleApproveReview()`:**
```diff
- await documentService.completeReview(documentId, true, 'Current User', 'Approved');
- 
  // Mark task as completed with approval flag for workflow integration
  await taskService.updateTaskStatus(selectedTaskForDetails.id, 'COMPLETED', true, 'Approved');
```

**Changed `handleDeclineReview()`:**
```diff
- await documentService.completeReview(documentId, false, 'Current User', 'Declined');
- 
  // Mark task as completed with rejection flag for workflow integration
  await taskService.updateTaskStatus(selectedTaskForDetails.id, 'COMPLETED', false, 'Declined');
```

### `frontend/src/components/Tasks/ReviewTasks.js`

✅ **No changes needed** - This component was already correct! It only calls `taskService.updateTaskStatus()`.

## ⚠️ Important: When to Use documentService.completeReview()

The `documentService.completeReview()` method should **ONLY** be used for:

1. **Legacy single-stage reviews** (not using workflows)
2. **Manual admin actions** (bypassing workflow)
3. **Testing/debugging** purposes

For **workflow-managed two-stage reviews**, the workflow handles all status updates via:
- `update-status` service tasks in the BPMN
- `DocumentWorkflowWorkers.handleUpdateStatus()` method

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario 1: Full Approval Path

1. **Start two-stage review**
   - Status: `IN_REVIEW`

2. **Initial reviewer (User 1) approves**
   - Task marked COMPLETED with `approved: true`
   - ✅ Status should change to: `IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW`
   - ❌ Status should NOT be: `RELEASED`

3. **Technical reviewer (User 2) approves**
   - Task marked COMPLETED with `approved: true`
   - ✅ Status should change to: `RELEASED`

### Test Scenario 2: Rejection at Initial Review

1. **Initial reviewer (User 1) rejects**
   - Task marked COMPLETED with `approved: false`
   - ✅ Status should change to: `IN_WORK`
   - Workflow completes (no technical review needed)

### Test Scenario 3: Rejection at Technical Review

1. **Initial reviewer approves** → Status: `IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW`
2. **Technical reviewer (User 2) rejects**
   - Task marked COMPLETED with `approved: false`
   - ✅ Status should change to: `IN_WORK`

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Workflow-managed reviews**: Only update task status, workflow handles document status
2. **Direct API calls** (`documentService.completeReview`): Only for non-workflow scenarios
3. **Status updates** are defined in the BPMN workflow, not in the UI
4. **The workflow is the single source of truth** for status progression

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Rebuild frontend** (if not using live reload):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache** to ensure new code is loaded

3. **Test the workflow** with both approval paths:
   - Full approval (initial → technical → released)
   - Rejection at each stage

4. **Check workflow-orchestrator logs** to verify status updates:
   ```
   🔄 Updating document status: {docId} -> IN_TECHNICAL_REVIEW
   ✓ Document status updated successfully
   ```

## ✅ Status

- [x] Identified root cause
- [x] Fixed `TaskManager.js` approval path
- [x] Fixed `TaskManager.js` rejection path
- [x] Verified `ReviewTasks.js` is correct
- [ ] Test with real workflow (pending restart)

**This fix is critical for two-stage review to work properly!** Without it, documents would always jump to RELEASED after the first approval, completely bypassing the technical review stage.
