# FINAL FIX APPLIED - File Metadata Issue Resolved

## Root Cause Found! üéØ

The metadata **WAS being saved** to the database, but **NOT being returned** in the API response!

### The Problem:
1. ‚úÖ `Document` entity had the metadata fields
2. ‚úÖ `attachFileWithMetadata()` was saving them correctly
3. ‚ùå `DocumentResponse` DTO was **missing** these fields
4. ‚ùå `DocumentMapper` wasn't **mapping** these fields

So the API responses never included the metadata, making it seem like nothing was saved!

---

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. Updated `DocumentResponse.java`
Added fields:
- `originalFilename`
- `contentType`
- `fileSize`
- `storageLocation`
- `fileUploadedAt`

Plus their getters and setters.

### 2. Updated `DocumentMapper.java`
Added mapping:
```java
response.setOriginalFilename(d.getOriginalFilename());
response.setContentType(d.getContentType());
response.setFileSize(d.getFileSize());
response.setStorageLocation(d.getStorageLocation());
response.setFileUploadedAt(d.getFileUploadedAt());
```

---

## Now You Must Restart!

```powershell
# 1. Stop document-service (Ctrl+C in its terminal)

# 2. Restart with new code
cd document-service
mvn clean spring-boot:run

# 3. Wait for: "Started DocumentServiceApplication"
```

---

## Testing After Restart:

### Test 1: Upload a NEW document
Upload via UI or API (old documents won't have metadata)

### Test 2: Check the response
```powershell
$docs = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/documents"
$docs[0] | Select-Object id, fileKey, originalFilename, contentType, fileSize, storageLocation
```

You should now see:
```
id              : abc-123
fileKey         : abc-123_document.pdf
originalFilename: document.pdf
contentType     : application/pdf
fileSize        : 12345
storageLocation : MINIO
```

### Test 3: Check file/info endpoint
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/documents/{id}/file/info"
```

Should return all metadata!

### Test 4: Delete file
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/documents/{id}/file" -Method Delete
```

Should work now!

## Why This Happened:

The disconnect between the **database layer** (Document entity) and the **API layer** (DocumentResponse DTO) meant:

- Backend: ‚úÖ Saving metadata correctly
- Database: ‚úÖ Has all metadata
- API Response: ‚ùå Not including metadata
- Frontend/Tests: ‚ùå Never saw the metadata

---

## All Changes Summary:

1. ‚úÖ Document.java - Added metadata fields (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ DocumentServiceImpl.java - Added attachFileWithMetadata() (DONE)
3. ‚úÖ DocumentController.java - Uses attachFileWithMetadata() (DONE)
4. ‚úÖ DocumentResponse.java - Added metadata fields (JUST DONE NOW)
5. ‚úÖ DocumentMapper.java - Maps metadata fields (JUST DONE NOW)

---

## Restart and Test!

This should be the final fix. After restart:
- ‚úÖ Metadata will be saved
- ‚úÖ Metadata will be returned in API
- ‚úÖ Delete will work
- ‚úÖ File info will work
- ‚úÖ Everything should work!

**Restart now and try uploading a fresh document!** üöÄ
