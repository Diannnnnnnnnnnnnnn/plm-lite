# ✅ Neo4j Task and User Sync - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What's Been Done

I've successfully integrated **Real-Time Neo4j Sync** for Task and User services:

### ✅ Graph Service (Neo4j API)
- ✅ Created `TaskSyncRequest` and `UserSyncRequest` DTOs
- ✅ Added sync endpoints in `GraphSyncController`:
  - `POST /api/graph/sync/task` - Sync tasks to Neo4j
  - `DELETE /api/graph/sync/task/{taskId}` - Delete tasks from Neo4j
  - `POST /api/graph/sync/user` - Sync users to Neo4j
  - `DELETE /api/graph/sync/user/{userId}` - Delete users from Neo4j
- ✅ Implemented `syncTask`, `syncUser`, `deleteTask`, `deleteUser` methods in `GraphSyncService`
- ✅ Added relationship linking (task-to-user, task-to-change, task-to-part, user-to-manager)

### ✅ Task Service
- ✅ Created `GraphServiceClient` Feign client
- ✅ Created `GraphServiceClientFallback` for graceful degradation
- ✅ Created `TaskSyncDto` for data transfer
- ✅ Updated `TaskService` (non-dev profile) to sync via Feign
- ✅ Updated `TaskServiceDev` (dev profile - currently active) to sync via Feign
- ✅ Configured Feign and graph service URL in `application.properties`
- ✅ Updated `TaskServiceApplication` to scan client packages

### ✅ User Service
- ✅ Updated `GraphClient` to use correct sync endpoint
- ✅ Created `GraphClientFallback` for graceful degradation
- ✅ Created `UserSyncDto` for data transfer
- ✅ Enabled graph sync in `UserService` (was previously disabled)
- ✅ Added sync on user create, update, and delete
- ✅ Enabled Eureka for service discovery
- ✅ Configured Feign and graph service URL in `application.properties`

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart All Services

You need to restart the services for the changes to take effect:

```powershell
# Stop all services first
.\stop-all-services.ps1

# Or manually stop:
# - graph-service (port 8090)
# - task-service (port 8082)
# - user-service (port 8083)
```

```powershell
# Start infrastructure (if not already running)
.\start-infrastructure.ps1

# Start services
cd infra/graph-service
mvn spring-boot:run

# In new terminal
cd task-service
mvn spring-boot:run

# In new terminal
cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Verify Services Are Running

Check that all services are healthy:

```powershell
# Graph Service
curl http://localhost:8090/api/graph/sync/health

# Task Service
curl http://localhost:8082/actuator/health

# User Service
curl http://localhost:8083/actuator/health
```

### Step 3: Create Test Data

#### Create a User

Via Web UI or API:

```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/users `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "password123",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "role": "Developer"
  }'
```

**Expected Log Output:**
```
✅ User testuser synced to graph successfully
```

#### Create a Task

Via API:

```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/tasks `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "taskName": "Review Document",
    "taskDescription": "Review the technical specifications",
    "taskType": "REVIEW",
    "assignedTo": "user1",
    "assignedBy": "admin",
    "dueDate": "2025-11-01T10:00:00",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "contextType": "DOCUMENT",
    "contextId": "doc123"
  }'
```

**Expected Log Output:**
```
✅ Task <task-id> synced to graph successfully
```

### Step 4: Verify in Neo4j Browser

Open Neo4j Browser: `http://localhost:7474`

**Login:**
- Username: `neo4j`
- Password: `password`

**Query to see everything:**

```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 100
```

**Query to count node types:**

```cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n)[0] as Type, COUNT(n) as Count
ORDER BY Count DESC
```

**Expected Result:**
```
Type      | Count
----------|------
User      | 30+   (existing + new)
Task      | 1+    (NEW! ✅)
Part      | 0+    
Document  | 0+    
Change    | 0+    
```

**Query to see Tasks with relationships:**

```cypher
MATCH (t:Task)
OPTIONAL MATCH (t)<-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(assignee:User)
OPTIONAL MATCH (t)-[:CREATED_BY]->(creator:User)
RETURN t.title as Task, 
       t.status as Status,
       assignee.username as Assignee,
       creator.username as Creator
```

**Query to see Users:**

```cypher
MATCH (u:User)
RETURN u.username as Username, 
       u.email as Email,
       u.department as Department,
       u.role as Role
LIMIT 20
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Graph service unavailable"

**Symptom:** You see warnings in task-service or user-service logs:
```
⚠️ Graph service unavailable - task <id> NOT synced to graph (graceful fallback)
```

**Solution:**
1. Check if graph-service is running:
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8090/api/graph/sync/health
   ```
2. Check if Eureka is running (port 8761)
3. Restart the service that's failing

**Note:** This is a **graceful failure** - your tasks and users will still be saved to MySQL even if Neo4j sync fails!

### Issue: Tasks/Users not appearing in Neo4j

**Check logs for:**
1. ✅ **Success message**: `✅ Task <id> synced to graph successfully`
2. ⚠️ **Warning message**: `⚠️ Failed to sync task to graph: <error>`

**Common causes:**
- Graph service not running
- Neo4j database not running
- Network connectivity issues
- Feign client misconfiguration

**Solution:**
1. Check all services are running
2. Check Neo4j is running: `http://localhost:7474`
3. Check service logs for detailed error messages

### Issue: Lombok errors during build

If you see lombok-related errors when building, run:

```powershell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

This will download dependencies and generate lombok code properly.

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Task Management with Graph Queries

**Find all tasks assigned to a user:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:User {username: 'user1'})<-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(t:Task)
RETURN t.title, t.status, t.dueDate
```

**Find overdue tasks:**
```cypher
MATCH (t:Task)
WHERE t.dueDate < datetime()
  AND t.status <> 'COMPLETED'
RETURN t.title, t.dueDate, t.assignee
```

**Find task dependencies (if parent-child relationships exist):**
```cypher
MATCH path = (parent:Task)-[:DEPENDS_ON*]->(child:Task)
RETURN path
```

### 2. User Activity Analysis

**Find users by department:**
```cypher
MATCH (u:User {department: 'Engineering'})
RETURN u.username, u.role
```

**Find who reports to whom (if manager relationships are set):**
```cypher
MATCH (u:User)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(manager:User)
RETURN u.username as Employee, manager.username as Manager
```

### 3. Cross-Entity Queries

**Find all tasks related to a specific part:**
```cypher
MATCH (t:Task)-[:RELATED_TO_PART]->(p:Part)
WHERE p.id = 'part123'
RETURN t.title, t.status, t.assignee
```

**Find all tasks related to a change request:**
```cypher
MATCH (t:Task)-[:RELATED_TO_CHANGE]->(c:Change)
WHERE c.id = 'change456'
RETURN t.title, t.status, t.assignee
```
