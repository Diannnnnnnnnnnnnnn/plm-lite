# User & Task Neo4j Sync - Current Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Graph Service (Neo4j API)** - ‚úÖ Running on port 8090
   - Has endpoints for syncing users and tasks
   - Successfully tested: `http://localhost:8090/api/graph/sync/health`

2. **User Service Integration** - ‚úÖ Code ready
   - GraphClient Feign client implemented
   - UserService updated to sync on create/update/delete
   - Eureka enabled for service discovery
   - **Status**: Starting now in new window

3. **Neo4j Database** - ‚úÖ Running
   - Accessible at http://localhost:7474
   - Ready to receive data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Task Service - NOT working yet
**Error**: Missing `FileStorageClient` bean

**This is a separate issue from user sync.** Task-service has a dependency problem unrelated to Neo4j integration.

**Quick Fix Options:**
1. Comment out `TaskFileController` temporarily
2. Create a mock `FileStorageClient` bean
3. Fix the file-storage-service integration

## üß™ Testing User Sync to Neo4j

### Step 1: Wait for User Service to Start

Watch the new PowerShell window that opened. Look for:
```
Started UserServiceApplication in X.XXX seconds (JVM running for Y.YYY)
```

### Step 2: Create a Test User

Once user-service is running:

```powershell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/users `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -Body '{
    "username": "neo4j_test",
    "password": "password123",
    "roles": ["ROLE_USER"]
  }'
```

### Step 3: Check User-Service Logs

In the user-service window, look for:

**‚úÖ Success:**
```
‚úÖ User neo4j_test synced to graph successfully
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (graph service unavailable):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Graph service unavailable - user <id> NOT synced to graph (graceful fallback)
```

**‚ùå Error:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to sync user to graph: <error message>
```

### Step 4: Verify in Neo4j Browser

1. Open http://localhost:7474
2. Login: `neo4j` / `password`
3. Run this query:

```cypher
MATCH (u:User) 
RETURN u.id, u.username, u.role
ORDER BY u.id DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Expected Result:**
- You should see your newly created user with ID and username
- If the user appears, **sync is working! ‚úÖ**
- If not, check the error messages in step 3

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Graph service unavailable" in logs

**Cause**: User-service can't reach graph-service

**Solutions:**
1. Verify graph-service is running:
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8090/api/graph/sync/health
   ```

2. Check if Eureka is running (if using service discovery):
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8761
   ```

3. Try direct connection - add to `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   eureka.client.enabled=false
   graph.service.url=http://localhost:8090
   ```

### Issue: User created but NOT in Neo4j

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Check graph-service logs** for incoming requests:
   - Should see: `Syncing user to graph: <id>`

2. **Test graph-service directly**:
   ```powershell
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/graph/sync/user `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -Body '{
       "id": "999",
       "username": "direct_test",
       "email": null,
       "department": null,
       "role": "ROLE_USER",
       "managerId": null
     }'
   ```

3. **Check Neo4j connection** in graph-service:
   - Look for Neo4j connection errors in graph-service logs
   - Verify `spring.neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687` in graph-service config

### Issue: User-service won't start

**Common causes:**

1. **Port 8083 already in use**:
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :8083
   ```
   Kill the process or change port

2. **Redis connection error** (if Redis is required):
   - Start Redis or disable it in config

3. **Database connection error**:
   - Check H2 database file permissions
   - Or start MySQL if configured

## üìä How the Sync Works

```
User Registration Request (API/UI)
         ‚Üì
    UserService.addUser()
         ‚Üì
  Save to MySQL/H2 ‚úÖ
         ‚Üì
  GraphClient.syncUser() ‚Üê Feign Client
         ‚Üì
  HTTP POST to graph-service:8090
         ‚Üì
  GraphSyncController.syncUser()
         ‚Üì
  GraphSyncService.syncUser()
         ‚Üì
  Save to Neo4j ‚úÖ
```

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Graceful failure**: If Neo4j is down, user still gets created in MySQL
- ‚úÖ **Automatic sync**: Happens on every create/update/delete
- ‚úÖ **Service discovery**: Uses Eureka to find graph-service
- ‚úÖ **Fallback**: Falls back to direct URL if Eureka fails

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

When everything is working, you should see:

1. **User-service logs:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ User <username> synced to graph successfully
   ```

2. **Graph-service logs:**
   ```
   Syncing user to graph: <id>
   User synced successfully: <id>
   ```

3. **Neo4j Browser:**
   ```cypher
   MATCH (u:User) RETURN count(u) as total_users
   ```
   Count should increase with each new user

4. **Relationship queries work:**
   ```cypher
   MATCH (u:User)<-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(t:Task)
   RETURN u.username, count(t) as tasks
   ```

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once users are syncing successfully:

1. ‚úÖ **Test user updates**:
   - Update a user and verify changes in Neo4j

2. ‚úÖ **Test user deletion**:
   - Delete a user and verify removal from Neo4j

3. üîß **Fix task-service** (separate issue):
   - Resolve FileStorageClient dependency
   - Then test task sync to Neo4j

4. üìä **Query user data**:
   - Build dashboards showing user relationships
   - Analyze user activity patterns
