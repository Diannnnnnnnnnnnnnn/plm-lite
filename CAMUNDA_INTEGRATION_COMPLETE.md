# ✅ Camunda Integration - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All components compiled and workflow-orchestrator running  
**Integration Scope:** Document Review Workflow with Camunda 8 (Zeebe)

---

## 🎉 What's Been Completed

### 1. ✅ Camunda Zeebe Client Integration
- **Added Zeebe client dependency** to `workflow-orchestrator/pom.xml`
- **Configured Zeebe connection** in `application.yml` (localhost:26500)
- **Created `ZeebeClientConfig`** for manual client bean creation and BPMN deployment
- **Successfully starts and connects** to Camunda Zeebe Gateway

### 2. ✅ BPMN Workflow Deployment
- **Deployed BPMN files** automatically on startup:
  - `document-approval.bpmn` - Document review workflow
  - `change-approval.bpmn` - Change approval workflow (future use)
- **Workflows are deployed** to Camunda and ready to use

### 3. ✅ Zeebe Job Workers Implemented
Created `DocumentWorkflowWorkers.java` with 3 service task handlers:

#### a) **create-approval-task** Worker
- Creates tasks in `task-service` for each reviewer
- Fetches user details from `user-service`
- Links tasks to the workflow instance
- Status: ✅ **Registered and Running**

#### b) **update-status** Worker
- Updates document status via `document-service`
- Handles approval/rejection outcomes
- Status: ✅ **Registered and Running**

#### c) **notify-completion** Worker
- Sends completion notifications
- Logs workflow results
- Status: ✅ **Registered and Running**

### 4. ✅ Workflow Service & Controller
- **Updated `WorkflowService`** to use Zeebe Client for:
  - Starting document approval workflows
  - Completing user tasks
  - Cancelling process instances
- **Updated `WorkflowController`** with REST endpoints:
  - `POST /api/workflows/document-approval/start` - Start new workflow
  - `POST /api/workflows/tasks/{jobKey}/complete` - Complete task
  - `DELETE /api/workflows/instances/{processInstanceKey}` - Cancel workflow
  - `POST /api/workflows/workflow/reviews/start` - **Legacy endpoint** (backward compatibility)

### 5. ✅ Shared Feign Clients & DTOs
Created dedicated, reusable components:
- **Feign Clients:**
  - `TaskServiceClient` - Interact with task-service
  - `UserServiceClient` - Fetch user information
  - `DocumentServiceClient` - Update document status
- **DTOs:**
  - `CreateTaskRequest` / `TaskResponse`
  - `UserResponse`
  - `DocumentStatusUpdateRequest`
  - `StartDocumentApprovalRequest`

### 6. ✅ Document Service Integration
- **Updated `DocumentServiceImpl`** to call `workflow-orchestrator` when starting reviews
- **Updated `WorkflowGatewayFeign`** to use new DTOs and endpoints
- **Compiled successfully** - ready to restart

### 7. ✅ Backward Compatibility
- **Legacy endpoint** `/api/workflows/workflow/reviews/start` still works
- Old calls are redirected to new implementation
- No breaking changes for existing frontend

### 8. ✅ Documentation Created
- `CAMUNDA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive integration guide
- `CAMUNDA_QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference
- `CAMUNDA_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of changes
- `CAMUNDA_FINAL_STATUS.md` - Testing instructions
- `start-camunda-workflow.bat` - Windows startup script

---

## 📋 Next Steps to Complete Testing

### Step 1: Restart document-service
```powershell
cd document-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Ensure Other Services Are Running
```powershell
# Check if services are running
netstat -ano | findstr "8081 8082 8083 3000"

# Start any missing services:
cd task-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test End-to-End Workflow

#### Via Frontend (Recommended):
1. **Open** `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Login** as a user (e.g., vivi)
3. **Go to Documents** section
4. **Create a new document** with:
   - Master ID: `TEST-001`
   - Version: `v1.0`
   - Select reviewers from the list
   - Upload a file
5. **Submit for Review**
6. **Expected Behavior:**
   - ✅ Document created with status "In Review"
   - ✅ Workflow started in Camunda (check console logs)
   - ✅ Review tasks created for selected reviewers
   - ✅ Tasks appear in each reviewer's task list
7. **Login as a reviewer**
8. **Complete the review task** (Approve/Reject)
9. **Expected Behavior:**
   - ✅ Task completed in workflow
   - ✅ Document status updated
   - ✅ Workflow progresses or completes

#### Via Camunda Operate (Advanced):
1. **Open** `http://localhost:8181`
2. **View** running process instances
3. **Monitor** workflow progress
4. **See** completed activities and variables

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Connection refused" to Zeebe
**Solution:** Ensure Camunda Docker containers are running:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\diang\Desktop\plm-lite\infra\docker-compose-8.7
docker-compose -f docker-compose-core.yaml up -d
```

### Issue: "No BPMN files found"
**Solution:** BPMN files should be in:
- `workflow-orchestrator/src/main/resources/bpmn/document-approval.bpmn`
- `workflow-orchestrator/src/main/resources/bpmn/change-approval.bpmn`

### Issue: "Failed to create task"
**Solution:** Ensure task-service is running on port 8082:
```powershell
cd task-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Issue: "User not found"
**Solution:** Ensure user-service is running on port 8083 and has users in database

### Issue: Tasks not appearing in Tasklist
**Solution:** 
- Check that reviewers are assigned by user ID
- Verify task-service is creating tasks with correct metadata
- Check workflow-orchestrator console for worker errors

## 🎯 What This Achieves

### Before Camunda Integration:
- ❌ Review workflow logic mixed with business code
- ❌ Hard to track workflow state
- ❌ Limited to single review point
- ❌ No workflow monitoring or auditing
- ❌ Difficult to modify workflow logic

### After Camunda Integration:
- ✅ **Clean separation** of workflow and business logic
- ✅ **BPMN visual workflows** that anyone can understand
- ✅ **Multiple review points** easily configurable
- ✅ **Full workflow monitoring** via Camunda Operate
- ✅ **Audit trail** of all workflow activities
- ✅ **Easy workflow modifications** by editing BPMN files
- ✅ **Scalable** - Zeebe handles distributed workflows
- ✅ **Resilient** - Automatic retries and error handling

---

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

**All code changes are complete and compiled.** The workflow-orchestrator is running and ready.

To complete the integration:
1. ✅ workflow-orchestrator is **RUNNING**
2. ⚠️ **Restart document-service** (compiled, ready to go)
3. ✅ Ensure task-service, user-service, and frontend are running
4. 🎯 **Test by creating and reviewing a document!**

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check console logs in the workflow-orchestrator window
2. Verify all services are running with `netstat -ano | findstr "8081 8082 8083 8086 26500"`
3. Check Camunda Operate at `http://localhost:8181` for workflow state
4. Review `CAMUNDA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting
