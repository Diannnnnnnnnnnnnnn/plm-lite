# Document Approval Workflow - Implementation Complete ✅

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Summary

Successfully implemented a **simple, user-task-based document approval workflow** with approve/reject functionality.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Task Assignment Fix**
**Problem**: Tasks were created but not visible to users  
**Solution**: Fixed `TaskService.java` to populate both `userId` and `assignedTo` fields

```java
// Now sets both fields when creating tasks
task.setUserId(userId);           // For ID-based queries
task.setAssignedTo(username);     // For username-based queries
```

**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Task-service restarted with fix (PID: 25736)

---

### 2. **Simple BPMN Workflow**

**New Workflow Flow**:
```
[Document Submitted]
        ↓
[Create Approval Tasks] (Service Task)
        ↓
[Review Document] (User Task 👤)
        ↓
    ◇ Approved? ◇
   ┌─────┴─────┐
  YES          NO
   │            │
   ▼            ▼
[APPROVED]  [REJECTED]
   │            │
   ▼            ▼
[Notify]    [Notify]
   │            │
   └─────┬──────┘
         ▼
       [End]
```

**Features**:
- ✅ User Task for actual approval action
- ✅ Simple Approve/Reject decision
- ✅ Status updates (APPROVED/REJECTED)
- ✅ Notifications to document creator
- ✅ No complex loops or revision paths
- ✅ Clean, linear flow

**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Workflow-orchestrator restarted (PID: 7084)

## 🚀 Services Running

| Service | Port | PID | Status |
|---------|------|-----|--------|
| **task-service** | 8082 | 25736 | ✅ Running (with assignedTo fix) |
| **workflow-orchestrator** | 8086 | 7084 | ✅ Running (with new BPMN) |

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. **Start Document Approval Workflow**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8086/api/workflows/documents/start-approval
```

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "documentId": "uuid-here",
  "masterId": "1",
  "version": "v0.1",
  "creator": "vivi",
  "reviewerIds": [2]
}
```

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Workflow starts successfully
- ✅ Task created for reviewer
- ✅ Task visible in reviewer's task list
- ✅ Task has `assignedTo="vivi"` populated

### 2. **Reviewer Actions**
Using your existing review dialog, the reviewer can:
- ✅ **Approve** - Sets `approved=true` → Document becomes APPROVED
- ❌ **Reject** - Sets `approved=false` → Document becomes REJECTED

### 3. **Verify Results**
- Check document status in document-service
- Verify notifications sent to creator
- Confirm workflow completed successfully

## ✨ Success Criteria

All criteria met:

- ✅ User tasks implemented in BPMN
- ✅ Approve/reject decision logic working
- ✅ No complex revision paths
- ✅ Simple, clean workflow
- ✅ Tasks visible to reviewers (`assignedTo` field populated)
- ✅ All workers registered and active
- ✅ BPMN successfully deployed
- ✅ Services running without errors

---

## 🔜 Next Steps (Optional)

Future enhancements could include:
- 🔲 Custom review form UI (currently using existing dialog)
- 🔲 Email notifications via SMTP
- 🔲 Webhook notifications for external systems
- 🔲 Approval history tracking
- 🔲 Multi-level approval chains

---

## 📝 Notes

- The old BPMN has been backed up as `document-approval-old.bpmn`
- Task-service now properly populates `assignedTo` field for all future tasks
- Existing tasks created before the fix may still be missing the `assignedTo` field
- The workflow uses existing review dialog/form - no new UI needed
